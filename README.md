:pencil2: Topic: **Comparative study of post-quantum key-exchange mechanisms and its implementations**

My primary task is to make a short paper and a presentation on this given topic.

:closed_book: Here is a list of things I have to do in order to get a grade:
*  Make a presentation of my findings
*  Maintain a diary of my work and updates
*  Give an update in November

ðŸ“Œ The steps I plan to take
*  Study about the key-exchange mechanism in general
*  List and compare the existing KEMs
*  Study about quantum-safe KEMs
*  List and compare the above
*  Keep a document about the knowledge I acquire - LaTeX document from the start

ðŸ§« Comments

**Oct 28**
*  Study about key-exchange in general
*  Study more about post-quantum key-exchange protocols than the above
*  Maybe make a list of state-of-the-art papers first
*  Then figure out the main implementation techniques implemented, maybe categorize them
*  Compare the above broadly

**Nov 03**
*  I will refer to this paper for the structure of my report: [Performance and comparison of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1111159/FULLTEXT01.pdf)
*  I will be using this library from [Open Quantum Safe](https://openquantumsafe.org/): [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)

**Nov 12**
*  Start writing the report.
*  Basic structure with the result section complete for at least 1 algorithm so that I can show.

ðŸ§® Left for future addition...
